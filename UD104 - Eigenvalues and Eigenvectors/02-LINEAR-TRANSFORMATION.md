# LINEAR TRANSFORMATION

Matrix:

```
[A B]
[C D]
```

When mapping a vector (on a 2D plane), a matrix can be used as a linear transformation tool to change the magnitude and direction of the vector.

Example:

```
Matrix A =
[3 -2]
[1  0]
```

Matrix has two rows and two columns.

Take vector i^ (read, i hat):

```
i =
[1]
[0]
```

Matrix A can transform i^ to

```
[3]
[1]
```

through matrix multiplication.

Similarly, j^ will transform to:

```
[0] to [-2]
[1]    [ 0]
```

When we use Matrix A to transform:

```
[-1] to [-5]
[ 1]    [-1]
```

we see that its magnitude and direction of the vector have changed.

If we use the same Matrix A to transform:

```
[2] to [4]
[1]    [2]
```

we see that its magnitude has changed (by a factor of 2) but the direction remains the same.
