# PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS

This is a tool used in machine learning, also called PCA. When working with machine learning, we usually deal with extremely large datasets that needs to be processed. So, we need reduction techniques to process this data.

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce a larger set to a smaller one.
