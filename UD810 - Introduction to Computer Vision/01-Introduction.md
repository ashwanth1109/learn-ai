# INTRODUCTION

Aimed at covering foundational aspects of how to analyze images and to extract content from images - a machine that can see and interpret images.

The goal is to label interesting things in an image and being able to track them as they move.

## Difference Computer Vision and Computational Photography

Similar when it comes to learning about computing with images and extracting information from images.

CP is really about capturing a light from a scene to record a scene into a photograph. Image analysis is done to support the capture and display it in novel ways.

CV is really about interpreting an analysis of the scene. What is the content of the image?

## Examples of CV

Optical Character Recognition lets you scan docs to text. Most digital cameras can detect faces (also CV) and facial recognition is already a part of many login systems.Object recognition has several applications such as in Google glass and computer vision is also used for special effects in movies. Smart cars use CV to identify pedestrians, road signs etc.
Video games employ vision based interaction (in Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect). Surveillance to monitor people in public places and medical imaging are other areas of CV.
