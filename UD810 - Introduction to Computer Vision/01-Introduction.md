# INTRODUCTION

Aimed at covering foundational aspects of how to analyze images and to extract content from images - a machine that can see and interpret images.

The goal is to label interesting things in an image and being able to track them as they move.

## Difference Computer Vision and Computational Photography

Similar when it comes to learning about computing with images and extracting information from images.

CP is really about capturing a light from a scene to record a scene into a photograph. Image analysis is done to support the capture and display it in novel ways.

CV is really about interpreting an analysis of the scene. What is the content of the image?

## Examples of CV

Optical Character Recognition lets you scan docs to text. Most digital cameras can detect faces (also CV) and facial recognition is already a part of many login systems.Object recognition has several applications such as in Google glass and computer vision is also used for special effects in movies. Smart cars use CV to identify pedestrians, road signs etc.
Video games employ vision based interaction (in Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect). Surveillance to monitor people in public places and medical imaging are other areas of CV.

## Why Computer Vision is Hard?

In the image above, we can perceive that A is the darker square and B is a light square with a cast shadow from the cylinder.

However, the two squares have the same measurement of intensity. So, seeing is not the same as measuring properties in the image. Seeing is building a perception of what the world is, using the measurements made by an imaging sensor.

Although the measurements are the same, the human brain is building a description based on the situation. The difference between straight image processing and computer vision is building that description.

## Pedagogy

Computer Vision is about using computational models and algorithms to process and interpret real images.
