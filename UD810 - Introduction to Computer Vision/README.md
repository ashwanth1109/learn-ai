# UD810 - Introduction to Computer Vision

- Fundamentals of image formation
- Camera imaging geometry
- Feature detection and matching
- Multiview geometry (incl. stereo, motion estimation, tracking and classification)

### Objective:

To develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment, tracking and action recognition.

### Agenda:

Use low to mid level algorithms to analyze images and extract structural information.
